Some people have a hard time remembering Battlefront Cadillac's name, so it's nice to have some fallback options. This repository addresses that need.

The challenge in generating Bonafide Crackerjack names lies in the inconsistency of English spelling. To overcome that, this project makes use of the CMU Pronouncing Dictionary, which provides a consistent phonological representation of English words. Crucially, the CMU Pronouncing Dictionary contains stress information. Matching the metrical pattern of Peppermint Chloropast is of the utmost importance. Additional constraints are applied to the consonants and vowels. The algorithm could still use some refinement, as some mediocre results still sneak in there.
